       <h3>Multithreading in Java</h3>
    <p>
        Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.<br>
        A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing.<br>
        we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a shared memory area.<br>
        They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory.<br>
        Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation, etc.<br>
    <h2>Advantages of Java Multithreading</h2>
        1) It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the same time.<br>
        2) You can perform many operations together, so it saves time.<br>
        3) Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.<br>
    <h2>Java Thread class</h2>
    Java provides Thread class to achieve thread programming. <br>
    Thread class provides constructors and methods to create and perform operations on a thread.<br>
    Java Thread class<br>

    <h2>Life cycle of a Thread</h2>
    A thread can be in one of the five states.<br>
    There is only 5 states in thread life cycle.<br>
    The life cycle of the thread in java is controlled by JVM.<br>
    The java thread states are as follows:<br>
    1.New<br>
    2.Runnable<br>
    3.Running<br>
    4.Non-Runnable (Blocked)<br>
    5.Terminated<br>
    <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/threadlifecycle.png" border="2"/>
    <b>1) New</b><br>
    The thread is in new state if you create an instance of Thread class but before the invocation of start() method.<br>
    <b>2) Runnable</b><br>
    The thread is in runnable state after invocation of start() method, but the thread scheduler has not selected it to be the running thread.<br>
    <b>3) Running</b><br>
    The thread is in running state if the thread scheduler has selected it.<br>
    <b>4) Non-Runnable (Blocked)</b><br>
    This is the state when the thread is still alive, but is currently not eligible to run.<br>
    <b>5) Terminated</b><br>
    A thread is in terminated or dead state when its run() method exits.<br>
    <h2>How to create thread</h2>
    There are two ways to create a thread:<br>
    1.By extending Thread class<br>
    2.By implementing Runnable interface.<br>
    <h2>1.extending Thread class:</h2><br>
    Thread class provide constructors and methods to create and perform operations on a thread.<br>
    Thread class extends Object class and implements Runnable interface.<br>
    Commonly used Constructors of Thread class:<br>
    ->Thread()<br>
    ->Thread(String name)<br>
    ->Thread(Runnable r)<br>
    ->Thread(Runnable r,String name)<br>
    Commonly used methods of Thread class:<br>
    ->public void run(): is used to perform action for a thread.<br>
    ->public void start(): starts the execution of the thread.JVM calls the run() method on the thread.<br>
    ->public void sleep(long miliseconds): Causes the currently executing thread to sleep for the specified number of milliseconds.<br>
    ->public void join(): waits for a thread to die.<br>
    ->public int getPriority(): returns the priority of the thread.<br>
    ->public int setPriority(int priority): changes the priority of the thread.<br>
    ->public String getName(): returns the name of the thread.<br>
    ->public void setName(String name): changes the name of the thread.<br>
    ->public Thread currentThread(): returns the reference of currently executing thread.<br>
    ->public int getId(): returns the id of the thread.<br>
    ->public Thread.State getState(): returns the state of the thread.<br>
    ->public boolean isAlive(): tests if the thread is alive.<br>
    ->public void suspend(): is used to suspend the thread.<br>
    ->public void resume(): is used to resume the suspended thread.<br>
    ->public void stop(): is used to stop the thread.<br>
    <h2>2.implementing Runnable interface:</h2><br>
    The Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread.<br>
    Runnable interface have only one method named run().<br>
    ->public void run(): is used to perform action for a thread.<br>
    <h2>Starting a thread:</h2><br>
    start() method of Thread class is used to start a newly created thread.<br>
    It performs following tasks:<br>
    ->A new thread starts.<br>
    ->The thread moves from New state to the Runnable state.<br>
    ->When the thread gets a chance to execute, its target run() method will run.<br>
    <h2>1) Java Thread Example by extending Thread class</h2>
    <code>
    class Multi extends Thread{<br>
    public void run(){<br>
    System.out.println("thread is running...");<br>
    }<br>
    public static void main(String args[]){<br>
    Multi t1=new Multi();<br>
    t1.start();<br>
    }<br>
    }<br>
    Output:thread is running...<br>
    </code>
    <h2>2) Java Thread Example by implementing Runnable interface</h2>
    <code>
    class Multi3 implements Runnable{<br>
    public void run(){<br>
    System.out.println("thread is running...");<br>
    }<br>
    public static void main(String args[]){<br>
    Multi3 m1=new Multi3();<br>
    Thread t1 =new Thread(m1);<br>
    t1.start();<br>
    }<br>
    }<br>
    Output:thread is running...<br>
    </code>
    <h3>Thread Priority</h3>
    Each thread have a priority.<br>
    Priorities are represented by a number between 1 and 10.<br>
    There are 3 constants defined in Thread class:<br>
    ->public static int MIN_PRIORITY<br>
    ->public static int NORM_PRIORITY<br>
    ->public static int MAX_PRIORITY<br>
    The value of MIN_PRIORITY is 1 and the value of MAX_PRIORITY is 10.<br>
    Example of priority of a Thread:<br>
    <code>
    class TestMultiPriority1 extends Thread{<br>
    public void run(){
    System.out.println("running thread name is:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());<br>
    System.out.println("running thread priority is:"+Thread.currentThread().getPriority());<br>
    }<br>
    public static void main(String args[]){<br>
    TestMultiPriority1 m1=new TestMultiPriority1();<br>
    TestMultiPriority1 m2=new TestMultiPriority1();<br>
    m1.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);<br>
    m2.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);<br>
    m1.start();<br>
    m2.start();<br>
    }<br>
    }<br>
        Output:running thread name is:Thread-0<br>
        running thread priority is:10<br>
        running thread name is:Thread-1<br>
        running thread priority is:1<br>
    </code>
