    <h2>Need of object oriented programming</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that uses objects in programming.</li>
    <li>Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming.</li>
    <li>The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Principles of Object Oriented languages</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>  There are 4 major principles that make a language Object Oriented</li>
    <li>  These are Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance.</li>
    <li>  These are also called as four pillars of Object Oriented Programming.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>1)Encapsulation</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods.</li>
    <li> Encapsulation: private instance variable and public accessor methods.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2)Abstraction</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.</li>
    <li> Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3)Inheritance</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.</li>
    <li> We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:</li>
    <li> subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class</li>
    <li>superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4)Polymorphism</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.</li>
    <li> Polymorphism uses inherited methods to perform different tasks.</li>
    <li>This allows us to perform a single action in different ways</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>OOP language Examples:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Java.</li>
    <li>JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Python.</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Visual Basic .NET.</li>
    <li>Ruby.</li>
    <li>Scala.</li>
    <li>PHP.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Applications of OOP languages:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> User interface design such as windows, menu.</li>
    <li>Real Time Systems</li>
    <li>Object oriented databases</li>
    <li>AI and Expert System</li>
    <li>Neural Networks and parallel programming</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>History of Java</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.</li>
    <li> Initially designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.</li>
    <li> Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.</li>
    <li> After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.</li>
    <li> In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Java Virtual Machine(JVM)</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> JVM is the engine that drives the Java code.</li>
    <li> Mostly in other Programming Languages, compiler produce code for a particular system but Java compiler produce Bytecode for a Java Virtual Machine.</li>
    <li> When we compile a Java program, then bytecode is generated. Bytecode is the source code that can be used to run on any platform.</li>
    <li> Bytecode is an intermediary language between Java source and the host system.</li>
    <li> It is the medium which compiles Java code to bytecode which gets interpreted on a different machine and hence it makes it Platform/Operating system independent.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>JVM Architecture</h2>

    <h3>1)ClassLoader</h3>
    <p> The class loader is a subsystem used for loading class files. It performs three major functions viz. Loading, Linking, and Initialization.</p>
    <h3>2)Method Area</h3>
    <p> JVM Method Area stores class structures like metadata, the constant runtime pool, and the code for methods.</p>
    <h3>3)Heap</h3>
    <p> All the Objects, their related instance variables, and arrays are stored in the heap. This memory is common and shared across multiple threads.</p>
    <h3>4)JVM language Stacks</h3>
    <p> Java language Stacks store local variables, and itâ€™s partial results.</p>
    <h3>5)PC Registers</h3>
    <p> PC register store the address of the Java virtual machine instruction which is currently executing.</p>
    <h3>6) Native Method Stacks</h3>
    <p> Native method stacks hold the instruction of native code depends on the native library. It is written in another language instead of Java.</p>
    <h3>7)Execution Engine</h3>
    <p> It is a type of software used to test hardware, software, or complete systems. The test execution engine never carries any information about the tested product.</p>
    <h3>8)Native Method interface</h3>
    <p> The Native Method Interface is a programming framework. It allows Java code which is running in a JVM to call by libraries and native applications.</p>
    <h3>9)Native Method Libraries</h3>
    <p> Native Libraries is a collection of the Native Libraries(C, C++) which are needed by the Execution Engine.</p>
