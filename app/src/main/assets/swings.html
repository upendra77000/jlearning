    <h2>Java Swings</h2>
    <p>
    ->Java Swing tutorial is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to create window-based applications.<br>
    ->It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API and entirely written in java.<br>
    ->Unlike AWT, Java Swing provides platform-independent and lightweight components.<br>
    The javax.swing package provides classes for java swing API such as<br>
    ->JButton<br>
    ->JTextField<br>
    ->JTextArea<br>
    ->JRadioButton<br>
    ->JCheckbox<br>
    ->JMenu<br>
    ->JColorChooser etc.<br>

        <tr><td>1)</td><td>AWT components are <b>platform-dependent</b>.</td><td>Java swing components are <b>platform-independent</b>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2)</td><td>AWT components are <b>heavyweight</b>.</td><td>Swing components are <b>lightweight</b>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3)</td><td>AWT <b>doesn't support pluggable look and feel</b>.</td><td>Swing <b>supports pluggable look and feel</b>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4)</td><td>AWT provides <b>less components</b> than Swing.</td><td>Swing provides <b>more powerful components</b> such as tables, lists, scrollpanes, colorchooser, tabbedpane etc. </td></tr>
        <tr><td>5)</td><td>AWT <b>doesn't follows MVC</b>(Model View Controller) where model represents data, view represents presentation and controller acts as an interface between model and view.</td><td>Swing <b>follows MVC</b>. </td></tr>
